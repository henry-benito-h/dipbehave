@messages
Feature: Messages
  As an instructor I want to do basic operation with message endpoints

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as "instructor"
    And I get a random user id from the list

  @acceptance @bvt
  Scenario: Create a message
    Given I have the next endpoint "/messages"
    And I have the body payload below
    """
    {
      "subject": "The subject of the message",
      "message": "The body of the message",
      "recipient_ids": ":random_user_id"
    }
    """
    When I do an api POST request
    Then I should have 201 as status code
      And response body should match with content
      """
      {
        "subject": "The subject of the message",
        "recipient_ids": ":random_user_id",
        "mid": null,
        "author_id": :my_id,

  Scenario: Update a message
    Given I have the next endpoint "/messages"
      And I have a record already created with this content

          "message": "The body of the message",
